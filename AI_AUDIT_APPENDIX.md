## AI Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot

## Per Task
1. Importing Data
- **Task:** Import project datasets from URLs and/or downloaded CSV files into the analysis pipeline.
- **Prompt:** "help me import this data" (with the dataset URL pasted in the prompt).
- **AI Output:** AI generated code to load the provided data sources into dataframes/files for use in the project workflow.
- **Verification:** We checked that the imported data matched the source data (file contents/structure looked correct), then shared results with Dr. Seagraves for confirmation.
- **Critique:**
	- **What AI did well:** Quickly produced working import code and reduced setup time.
	- **What needed human judgment:** Source-specific details (column naming consistency, file path handling, and format assumptions) still required manual review.
	- **Our corrections/actions:** We validated imported outputs against the original source and used instructor confirmation before proceeding.

	- **Our corrections/actions:** 

3. README File
**Task:** Helped fill out information about the project such as the data set overveiw and how to pun the pipeline.
- **Prompt:** "Help me data set overveiw and how to pun the pipeline along with filling out more information about files and subfiles" 
- **AI Output:** The AI edited the read me to include all needed information in the read me. 
- **Verification:** I went and checked the data and code it refrenced was correct.
- **Critique:**
	- **What AI did well:** Imported the information in an easy to read way. 
	- **What needed human judgment:** Make sure the sentences were easy to understand and everything was clear. 
	- **Our corrections/actions:** Edited some lines of text. 

4. Master Code

	- **What needed human judgment:** 
	- **Our corrections/actions:** 

5. Data Quality Report
**Task:** Helped create, organize, and fill out the data quality report.
- **Prompt:** Create a file called "Data Quality Report" and help me organize data about the types of data sources, the cleaning desisions made, merge stratagies, final data set summary, repoducability steps, and ethical considerations.
- **AI Output:** The ai, created a document and filled out, and organized as much as it could. 
- **Verification:** Double checked all info it used was correct 
- **Critique:**
	- **What AI did well:** Pulled acurate data and code. 
	- **What needed human judgment:** Some sentences were incorect due to incompleate data, and some were also unclear. 
	- **Our corrections/actions:** Edited all outputs to make sure they were correct
