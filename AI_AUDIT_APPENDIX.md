# Disclose, Verify, Critique

## AI Tools Used
- [x] GitHub Copilot

## Per Task
- **Task:** Import project datasets from URLs and/or downloaded CSV files into the analysis pipeline.
- **Prompt:** "help me import this data" (with the dataset URL pasted in the prompt).
- **AI Output:** AI generated code to load the provided data sources into dataframes/files for use in the project workflow.
- **Verification:** We checked that the imported data matched the source data (file contents/structure looked correct), then shared results with Dr. Seagraves for confirmation.
- **Critique:**
	- **What AI did well:** Quickly produced working import code and reduced setup time.
	- **What needed human judgment:** Source-specific details (column naming consistency, file path handling, and format assumptions) still required manual review.
	- **Our corrections/actions:** We validated imported outputs against the original source and used instructor confirmation before proceeding.

## Summary
AI was used for initial data-ingestion support (importing datasets from URLs/CSVs). Primary use case was speeding up boilerplate import code. Verification was completed through manual source checks plus instructor confirmation.

Responsibility: All code is tested and our responsibility.
